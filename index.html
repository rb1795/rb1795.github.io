      <h2>ClojureX 2016</h2>
      <p>This is my first blog and I'm just going to give a quick summary of my experiences of the ClojureX conference held at SkillsMatter <br> on the 1st/2nd Decmember 2016.</p>
      
      <p>Prior to the conference, I had about 2 months of both Clojure (and programming in general) experience. So I turned up to the conference on Thursday morning with the basics known but a little apprehension that the majority of the talks would go straight over my head. And to an extent I was right. There were lots of ideas and terminology that I did not understand and could not follow. But, I was surprised at the amount I could follow, even with my limited Clojure knowledge. The talks were given in a manner that was easy to understand and kept me engaged for the whole talk.</p>
      
      <p>As a result I have a more confidence in my intital understanding of Clojure, and I now want to learn more about the topics in the talks. In particular, the topics that really caught my attention were Clojure.spec and Kafka streams.</p>
      
      <p>I really enjoyed the conference, it was well run and the venue was ideal. I am already looking forward to next year.</p>
